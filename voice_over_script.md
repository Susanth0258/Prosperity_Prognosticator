# Voice Over Script: Prosperity Prognosticator (Short Version)

"Hello everyone! Welcome to the presentation of 'Prosperity Prognosticator'—a machine learning tool designed to predict startup success.

In the world of entrepreneurship, only a few startups survive their first few years. Investors often struggle to decide which ideas are worth the risk. Our project, Prosperity Prognosticator, aims to solve this by providing data-backed predictions.

Our solution is a simple web application built with Flask. It analyzes nine key factors that historically determine if a startup will succeed or fail. These include things like the startup's existing relationships, the total funding they've raised, and the milestones they have achieved. By looking at these metrics, our platform can instantly predict if a startup is likely to be 'Acquired'—which signifies success—or 'Closed'.

Technically, we use a Random Forest model, which was trained on data from over nine hundred historical startups. We chose this model because it’s excellent at finding patterns in complex data. The entire system is built with Python, making it both fast and reliable.

The results are impressive! Our tool can generate a prediction in less than two hundred milliseconds with very high precision. For investors, it acts as a quick screening tool. For founders, it provides a realistic look at their startup's health based on hard data.

In the future, we hope to expand our dataset and include even more detailed features, like news sentiment analysis. Prosperity Prognosticator is all about using data to make better decisions in the startup world. 

Thank you for watching, and feel free to check out our code on GitHub!"
